	 <p>
	 	<b>Lorem Lpsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Loren Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500<em>s</em>, when an unkown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electrinic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960<em>s</em> with the release of letraset sheets containing loren Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <b><u><em>Aldus PageMaker</em></u></b> including versions of <u>Loren Ipsum</u>.<b>1914 translation by H. Rackham</b>

	 	<h3 style="color: red; background: white"><b>Why do we use it??</b></h3><br>
	 	It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letter, as opposed to using "Content here, content here",making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their defaul model text, and a search for "lorem Ipsum" will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various version have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

	 	<h3 style="color: green; background: white"><b>Where can I get some?</b></h3><br>
	 	<b>There are many variation of passage of Loren Ipsum available, but the suffered alteration in some form, by injection humoun, or <u>randomized words</u> which don't look even slightly belieable.</b> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embrassing hiden in the middle of text. <em>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the internet tend to repeat predefined chuncks as neccessary, making this the first true on the internet.</em>It uses adictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence sturctures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from reperition, injection humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
